So I have migrated my blog site over from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) with [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/)
to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The reasons for this were manyfold. They were:

-   Needed a revamp
-   Save money
-   Simplified blogging system

The repo for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/wingy3181/wingy3181.github.io" target="\_blank">here</a>

I am not 100% sure how often I will actually blog because last time was probably a complete failure. This time I will see how it goes but
mainly I want to keep it as a personal branding of myself on the digital web. From time to time, I may add posts for my personal thoughts
on things going on in my life and things I am currently learning.

Below is an animated gif of my old site :smile: (which I have dockerized into a private repo for now, just in case I ever want to resurrect it)
